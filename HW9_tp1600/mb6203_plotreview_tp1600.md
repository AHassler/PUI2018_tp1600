## Plot review for mb6203 

Overall, the plot looks good and makes good use of color. Highest and lowest values are clearly differentiated with the yellow indicating highest and dark color indicating lowest score. 

A caption explaining some more background on the metric being plotted and its relevant would be helpful in interpretting the plot, as well as specific unit shown. 

There are several blank zipcodes, it would be useful for the viewer to detail the significance of the NULL in this locations (whether information is unavailable, not rlevant, or it simply has no projects underway) if this information was readily avalable.
