## Plot review for jz3525

![Alt text](../HW8_tp1600/pui_hw81.png)

Overall, the plot looks good. It is easy to read and clear, with good labelling on all axes. While an upward trend is apparent through the visualization, a caption would be helpful in understanding the key messages communicated by the plot.

Outliers were removed during the processing, the impact of which does not seem to distort the overall messaging so I would consider this appropriate judgement and good practice.

The title indicates correlation, but the specifics of the strength of correlation or the equation associated with the line are not given, this might be helpful to provide to reinforce the messaging of the visual. The model does without intercept does appear to be appropriate.

Aesthetically, the color usage is good overall-- with sensitivity to color blind coloring using red and blue. Personally, I prefer a white background but appreciate the use of gray to enable a softer gridline. The gridlines, while valuable for estimating slope, might be unnecessary if that information is provided as the goal of the plot is likely to convey relationship rather than particular values. The use of smaller markers and a bold red line helps to highlight the overall relationship without cluttering the visual.
