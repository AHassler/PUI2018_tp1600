## Homework Assignment 4

This homework assignment included three assignments. 

The first assignment (HW4_Assignment1) demonstrates the Central Limit Theorem using random samples from 5 different distributions.

The second assignment (Assignment 2) states a NULL and Alternative hypothesis that can be tested using Citibike Data.

The third assignment (Assignment3) completes a z test for the new bus route X8 to determine the impact it's had on average commute time.

I worked alone on these assignments.
